# Multiple-Linear-regression-
The advertising experiment between Social Media Budget (on youtube, facebook and newspapers) and Sales (in Thousands $ ) by multiple linear regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. 
The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable.
In this dataset predicted value is Sales and explanatory variables are money spend on advertising of youtube, facebook and newspapers.

Normal Equation is an analytical approach to Linear Regression with a Least Square Cost Function.
We can directly find out the value of Î¸ without using Gradient Descent.
Following this approach is an effective and a time-saving option when are working with a dataset with small features.
